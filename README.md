# Cameron-Portfolio : Homework-7

Updated portfolio to add first project and additional homeworks that have been completed during the course. Each update includes a link to the application as well as an icon of the application page. 

Updated side nav and header in order to dedicate side nav as link resource and header as main contact section. Added LinkedIn page and GitHub page to the side nav and made pages accessible by click.

Additionally, I updated my LinkedIn and Github pages to include a little bit more information about myself and pinned a few of my projects to my Github profile as well.

# Cameron-Portfolio : Homework-2

Created portfolio that will be utilized to highlight my webdevelopment projects throughout this course. Contains a small blurb about the current course taking as well as what I am doing professionally. 

Navigation section: I have included the three sections in my navigation bar. These will link you directly to each section, and provide the best viewing experience. The projects section s linked to #project2 in order to capture all projects on redirect.

Contact Inormation section: I have included a contact information section for those that wish to view my resume or contact me via phone or email. Feel free to click on the links for the resume, email, or phone. I have created anchor tags that will direct you to the resources highlighted in each section.

Projects section: I hae included a list of projects that I have worked on or will work on in the future. Each project has a brief description and contains a hover feature, which once clicked on will direct you to the specific project. The yet-completed projects contain place-holder text, and link to google.com. As I complete the projects outlined, I plan on installing a proper description and the correct hrefs.

## Late Fix for HW
 Refactored code on .project4, .project5, .project6 in the Projects section. Commented out submitted syntax, but made change for future use. Added border property to each project to better differentiate them.
